# Stonebreaker, the original series
Tool for ~~TFS~~ project tracking (for an agile ~~TFS~~ based project):
  - ~~Recover data about tasks for differents sprints and projects from a remote TFS repo~~. Showing forms for manual entering data ~~(may StoneBreaker, the Next Generation, would connect a TFS repo)~~.
  - Grouping data.
  - Show data for a person ~~in a graphical way~~ for project management pourposes.
  - List of ~~areas~~projects+sprints.
  - Associate every user story with projects and its state, pre-sprint and post-sprint.
  - List a small timed task management.

## Changes
  1. From Elm to Purescript: More options and a language more near Haskell with better javascript interop.
  2. What I want in this project? What I need for the app?
