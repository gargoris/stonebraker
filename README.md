# Stonebreaker, the original series
Tool for ~~TFS~~ project tracking (for an agile ~~TFS~~ based project):
  - ~~Recover data about tasks for differents sprints and projects from a remote TFS repo~~. Showing forms for manual entering data ~~(may StoneBreaker, the Next Generation, would connect a TFS repo)~~.
  - Grouping data.
  - Show data for a person ~~in a graphical way~~ for project management.
  - List of ~~areas~~projects+sprints.
  - Associate every user story with projects and its state, pre-sprint and post-sprint.
  - List a small timed task management.

## Changes and some thougts
  1. ~~From Elm to Purescript: More options and a language more near Haskell with better javascript interop.~~ Back to Elm: too much confusion in Purescript terrains
  2. What I want in this project? 
  3. What I need for the app?
  4. Where will the database be hosted?
  5. Do I need a backend with an API between front app and database?
  6. I know that I don't want to code a lot in back and I need the app as fast as I can, so, what options do I have related with JSON/document DBs?
